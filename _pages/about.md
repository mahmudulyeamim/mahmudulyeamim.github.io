<div style="text-align: justify;">

  <p><span aria-hidden="true"></span> Hi, there!</p>

  <p>Welcome to <strong>Md. Mahmudul Hasan</strong>'s website! I am a senior undergraduate student in <strong>Computer Science and Engineering</strong> at the <strong>University of Dhaka</strong>, where I have focused on developing a strong foundation in both theoretical and applied principles.</p>

  <p>I am deeply interested in the recent advancements of <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>, which have led me to pursue research in this field. Currently, I work as an <strong>Undergraduate Research Assistant</strong> at the <strong>Cognitive Agents and Interaction Lab (CAIL)</strong> under the supervision of <a href="https://mmkhansajeeb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Md. Mosaddek Khan</a>. My research interests broadly include:</p>

  <!-- Visual echo of your interests (kept your original sentence above untouched) -->
  <ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 1rem 1.2rem;">
    <li><strong>Machine Learning (ML)</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Large Language Models (LLMs)</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Vision-Language Models (VLMs)</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Multimodal Learning</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Beyond research, I have a strong passion for <strong>algorithmic problem solving</strong> and devoted much of my early undergraduate years to <strong>competitive programming</strong>. I have also aimed to build a solid understanding of <strong>software engineering</strong> through various academic projects.</p>

  <p>Looking ahead, I hope to engage in <strong>innovative research projects</strong> that challenge my abilities and allow me to contribute meaningfully to the field.</p>

        <span style="color:rgb(34, 75, 141)"><strong>
        I'm expected to graduate before Jan 2026 and am currently on the job market (for both academic and industrial opportunities). 
        I would greatly appreciate it if you could email me about any available opportunities!

[**GraDeT-HTR: A Resource-Efficient Bengali Handwritten Text Recognition System utilizing Grapheme-based Tokenizer and Decoder-only Transformer**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18081) 

**Md. Mahmudul Hasan**, Ahmed Nesar Tahsin Choudhury, Mahmudul Hasan, Md. Mosaddek Khan

- Utilizes a decoder-only architecture for Bengali handwritten text recognition without any pretrained LM.
- Employs a grapheme-based tokenizer, which significantly boosts recognition accuracy.

    <div class="abstract"  style="overflow: hidden; display: none;">  
        <p> Despite Bengali being the sixth most spoken language in the world, handwritten text recognition (HTR) systems for Bengali remain severely underdeveloped. The complexity of Bengali script--featuring conjuncts, diacritics, and highly variable handwriting styles--combined with a scarcity of annotated datasets makes this task particularly challenging. We present GraDeT-HTR, a resource-efficient Bengali handwritten text recognition system based on a Grapheme-aware Decoder-only Transformer architecture. To address the unique challenges of Bengali script, we augment the performance of a decoder-only transformer by integrating a grapheme-based tokenizer and demonstrate that it significantly improves recognition accuracy compared to conventional subword tokenizers. Our model is pretrained on large-scale synthetic data and fine-tuned on real human-annotated samples, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets. </p>
